# Events Tasks

For solving the tasks use kibana and the `events-*` index pattern.

1. Query: Find an event of the service imageflip (together)
2. Query: Find all imageflip transactions that have a duration higher than 1000ms (last 10h). Which one took the longest?
3. Visualize: percentiles of durations of imagegrayscale events.
